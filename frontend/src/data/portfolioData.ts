      "What followed was an end-to-end intervention — temporary shelter, school enrolment for every child, monthly ration support for the older sister who had been keeping the family together, and a network of donors who committed to the children's education for the next decade.",
      "Today, three of those children are in college on Aaghaz scholarships, and one has cleared her Class XII board exams with a first division.",

      "This story is, in many ways, the heart of Aaghaz Foundation: not big buildings or noisy campaigns, but a steady, lit-up room that says \"come in, sit down, and study.\"",
