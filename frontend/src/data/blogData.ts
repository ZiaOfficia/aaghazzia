      <p>At Aaghaz, we believe that honesty is everything. We do not give scholarships just by looking at online forms or certificates. Instead, we check every application in person.</p>
      
      <h3>The Verification Process</h3>
      <p>Our volunteers visit the student's home. At least two volunteers meet the family, talk to the neighbors, and visit the student's school. This helps us check:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the family really cannot pay the fees.</li>
        <li>If the child really wants to study and gets good marks.</li>
        <li>If the family has other problems (like sickness or job loss) where we can help.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Ensuring Direct Impact</h3>
      <p>This personal check makes sure that 100% of your donation goes to a child who really needs it. It builds trust with our donors and creates a personal bond between volunteers and students.</p>
