      question: "How does Aaghaz decide who gets help?",
      answer:
        "Every recommended student is verified through an in-person pre-scholarship survey by at least two volunteers. Only after both reports agree do we onboard the student. We do not run a generic application form — every case is real, met and documented.",
    },

      question: "Are donations tax-exempt?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Aaghaz Foundation is a registered non-profit and donations made by Indian residents are eligible for tax exemption under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Receipts are issued within seven working days of every donation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I direct my donation to a specific programme?",

      question: "How do I become a volunteer?",
